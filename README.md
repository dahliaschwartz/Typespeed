# Typespeed

TypeSpeed is a typing competition against yourself to see how many words
you can type before running out of your three lives. Simply type the words as 
they appear on the screen. When you type a word that appears on the
screen, the word will disappear from the screen. When a word completely 
disappears from the right side of the screen, you will lose one life. 
After three lives are lost, the game will display the "Game Over" screen.

Reminder - (also listed in instructions page of game):
If you want to erase the last letter typed, press the "delete" key.
If you want to clear the whole word being typed, press the "return" key.

Before running the code:
Make sure to download the word file labeled 1000words.py
