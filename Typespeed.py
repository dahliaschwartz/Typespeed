# TypeSpeed

# "I hereby certify that this program is solely the result of my own work and 
# is in compliance with the Academic Integrity policy of the course syllabus 
# and the academic integrity policy of the CS department.”

# Before running the code:
# Make sure to download the word file labeled 1000words.py
# THIS CODE WAS WRITTEN ON A MAC.

# TypeSpeed is a typing competition against yourself to see how many words 
# you can type before running out of your three lives. Simply type the words
# as they appear on the screen. When you type a word that appears on the
# screen, the word will disappear from the screen. When a word completely 
# disappears from the right side of the screen, you will lose one life. 
# After three lives are lost, the game will display the "Game Over" screen.

# Reminder - (also listed in instructions page of game):
# If you want to erase the last letter typed, press the "delete" key.
# If you want to clear the whole word being typed, press the "return" key.

# Disclaimer:
# My project proposal implied that there will only be one life in this game. 
# However, with permission, I changed it to be that the player has three lives
# before the game ends.
